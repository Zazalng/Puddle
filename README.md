# Puddle

Puddle is an AI chatbot application developed in Java, designed to provide users with an interactive and enjoyable chatbot experience. It is built upon the JDA library, enabling seamless integration with Discord, where users can engage in conversations with the bot.

## Motivation

Recognizing the need for a replacement, Puddle was conceived to carry on the legacy of Eli, ensuring users could continue to enjoy a similar chatbot experience.

## Features

- Discord Integration: Puddle seamlessly integrates with Discord, allowing users to interact with the bot through the platform.
- Natural Language Processing: Incorporating NLP libraries like Apache OpenNLP, Puddle enhances its understanding of user queries, enabling effective processing and interpretation.
- Familiarity and Continuity: Puddle's goal is to capture the style and mannerisms established by Eli, providing users with a sense of familiarity and continuity.
- Reliable and Enjoyable: Puddle strives to deliver a reliable and enjoyable chatbot experience, ensuring users have a seamless transition from Eli to Puddle.
