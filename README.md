# Puddle
Puddle is an AI chatbot application developed in Java, born out of the need for a replacement after the discontinuation of the Eli project. Eli, a highly regarded bot developed by a talented developer, served as the inspiration for Puddle's creation.

Built upon the JDA library, Puddle seamlessly integrates with Discord, enabling users to engage in interactive conversations. The goal was to recreate the command structure and behavior of Eli, ensuring that users could continue to enjoy a similar experience with Puddle.

By incorporating NLP libraries like Apache OpenNLP, Puddle enhances its natural language understanding capabilities, allowing for effective processing and interpretation of user queries. The focus is on delivering responses that align with the style and mannerisms established by Eli, providing users with a sense of familiarity and continuity.

Although developer Eli did not directly contribute to Puddle's development, the bot's features and behavior are rooted in Eli's legacy. Puddle aims to carry on the spirit of Eli by offering a reliable and enjoyable chatbot experience that captures the essence of the original project.

In summary, Puddle is an AI chatbot application created as a successor to the discontinued Eli project. With its integration into Discord, advanced NLP capabilities, and a dedication to emulating Eli's features, Puddle strives to provide users with a seamless transition and a chatbot experience reminiscent of the beloved Eli bot.
